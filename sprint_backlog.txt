Backlog description: Image Processing
a. Assigned: Sean Hordines
b. Technical Description: Large images have thousands to millions of color. The app must find the best K colors to describe the image without losing detail. The image must also be scaled to the resolution of the game grid. The image transformations in order are resizing, a color space conversion (rgb to lab), a bilateral filter (to reduce noise), mean shift clustering and k means (to find the best colors), color replacement, and finally converting back to rbg and scaling up.
c. Difficulty: Hard

b. Technical Description: The game model compares the values of the colors that the user paints and compares them against the true colors in the processed image. If they match, the painting is complete and the user "wins".
c. Difficulty: Hard

● Backlog description: Default image selector
